## Character Prediction LSTM on the Text data from Tolstoy Book

In this project we will train a character prediction LSTM that predicts the next character given previous characters. The training data is from the book "War and Peace" by Leo Tolstoy. 

More details provided in the [CharLSTM.ipynb](https://github.com/MehradSm/Character-Prediction-LSTM-on-Tolstoy-Story/blob/master/CharLSTM.ipynb) jupyter notebook file. 

This project has been done by me under the supervision of Prof. Brian Kulis.
